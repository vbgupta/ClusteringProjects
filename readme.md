# This Repo contains a few clustering projects that I have worked on
## The forms of clustering algorithms that I have tackled are:
1. K-means Clustering
2. Hierarchical Clustering
3. Agglomerative Clustering

### K-means Clustering:
> Used sklearn's make_blobs dataset that generates isotropic Gaussian blobs for clustering
